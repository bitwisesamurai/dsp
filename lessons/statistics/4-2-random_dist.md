[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

```python
# Exercise 2.4 - Are numbers generated by `random.random` uniform between 0 and 1? i.e. Does every value in this range have the same probability?

# Generate 1,000 random numbers
random_nums = np.random.random(1000)

cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random_nums)

thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')

# The plot shows a line that's straight; it's therefore reasonable to say that every value generated by
# `random.random` has the same probability of occuring
```
